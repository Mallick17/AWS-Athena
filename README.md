# AWS-Athena
### What is Amazon Athena?
- Athena is an AWS service that allows you to **query data stored in Amazon S3 using SQL**.  
- It supports various data types, including log files, order data, and more.  
- **Serverless**, meaning no need to manage infrastructure—AWS handles compute automatically.  
- Executes queries **in parallel** for fast results.  

### **Why Use Athena?**  
- **Query logs** (CloudWatch, VPC Flow Logs, CloudTrail).  
- **Business intelligence & analytics** (analyze and visualize data with QuickSight).  
- **Any use case where you need SQL queries on S3 data**.  

### **Pricing:**  
- **Pay per query**—$5 per terabyte of data scanned.  
- No upfront costs or infrastructure management.
